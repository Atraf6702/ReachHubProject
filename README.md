The project was created with the help of Reactjs and Bootstrap.
There will be a need for some extra modules to run this app such as react-router-dom and react-icons, so please install these before starting the development server.
The app's src combines many components to produce the overall website.
The website is entirely made with the reference(demo) provided.

Finally, after installing all the required packages, such as react-scripts and all, run npm start.
