The project was created with the help of Reactjs and Bootstrap.
There will be a need for some extra modules to run this app such as react-router-dom and react-icons, so please install these before starting the development server.
The app's src combines many components to produce the overall website.
The website is entirely made with the reference(demo) provided.

I feel sorry because I can't make the website completely responsive due to the unavailability of time.

Finally after installing all the required packages, such as react-scripts and all, run npm start.
